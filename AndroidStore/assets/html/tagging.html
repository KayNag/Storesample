<h2>Tagging</h2>
<p>Tagging lets you set phrases for your items so that you can find them more easily through searches. For example, you could tag all your Spanish-language CDs as "latin."</p>
<p>You can add up to 8 tags, 20 characters long. Commas are not permitted in tags.</p>
<p>To tag an item:
	<ol>
		<li>On the Main screen, <strong>long press</strong> an item, and select <strong>Tags</strong>.</li>
		<li>Type any phrases you wish. There is also a list of previously used tags on your items for quick access.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>Tag information is saved when you <a href="exporting.html">export items to Shelves</a>.</p>
<p>Tagging also lets you filter your items. For example, if you have some items tagged with "comics," you can filter the items by that specific type. Filters are joined together, so, items labeled as "comics" and "classic" can be filtered by selected both the "comics" and "classic" checkboxes. This allows you to create categorizations, or sub-shelves, in your collection.</p>
<p>If you already have a large collection, you can choose to mass-edit the tags in another application, then reimport your list. To edit the tags on all your items at once:
	<ol>
		<li>Export your collection as a Shelves file by clicking the <strong>Menu</strong> button, then <strong>Settings&rarr;Export&rarr;[Item]&rarr;Shelves</strong>.</li>
		<li>On your computer, import this text file into a program that understands tab-separated files, such as a spreadsheet application. You could use a text-editing application, too, as long as the display isn't set to wrap.</li>
		<li>Under the column <em>tags</em>, define tags for your items. When you're finished, export the data as a tab-separated file called <em>Shelves_to_Shelves_[Item].txt</em>, where [Item] is the capitalized plural name of the item you're exporting, such as Apparel, Books, Gadgets, Movies, Music, Software, Tools, Toys, or VideoGames.</li>
		<li>Copy <em>Shelves_to_Shelves_[Item].txt</em> to the root of your device's SD card.</li>
		<li>Delete your existing collection by going to <strong>Settings&rarr;Delete Everything</strong>.</li>
		<li>Reimport your Shelves collection by importing the saved file with your defined tags: click <strong>Settings&rarr;Import&rarr;[Item]&rarr;Shelves</strong>.</li>
	</ol>
</p>	
<p>The import re-adds your collection, plus the tags that you defined.</p>
