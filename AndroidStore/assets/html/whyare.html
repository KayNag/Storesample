<p>As you might have guessed, Shelves relies on The Internet to populate information about all of the items it manages. It asks a database whether or not an item exists, and if it does, pulls that information down. To put it simply, unless there's a source online that's willing to provide information about an item, it's impossible for the app to fetch it.</p>
<p>Similarly, different sources provide different pieces of information. For example, the source that provides information about board games does not provide information on barcodes for those games; thus, there's no capability to use the scanner whatsoever. Other item types offer more information, and so Shelves works around that content to provide a rich user experience.</p>
<p>The same is true for region support. Shelves can only acquire regional information if a source for that region exists. It's not a matter of preference or prejudice; it's all about finding a reliable source online that provides specific product information about a region. At the moment, only items from the following regions are supported:
<ul>
	<li>United States</li>
	<li>Canada</li>
	<li>United Kingdom</li>
	<li>France</li>
	<li>Germany</li>
	<li>Japan</li>
	<li>Italy</li>
	<li>China</li>
</uL>
</p>
<p>If you know of a region or item that can be supported, by all means, contact me and I'll try to add it!</p>
