<h2>Rating</h2>
<p>You can rate your items to add an extra level of personal detail.</p> 
<p>To rate an item:
	<ol>
		<li>On the Main screen, long press an item, and select <strong>Rate</strong>.</li>
		<li>Slide your finger across the stars to set a rating.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>By going into <a href="settings.html">Settings</a>, you can choose to sort your items by their rating. Rating information is also kept when you <a href="exporting.html">export items to Shelves</a>.</p>
<p>If you already have a large collection, you can choose to mass-edit the ratings in another application, then reimport your list. To edit the ratings on all your items at once:
	<ol>
		<li>Export your collection as a Shelves file by clicking the <strong>Menu</strong> button, then <strong>Settings&rarr;Export&rarr;[Item]&rarr;Shelves</strong>.</li>
		<li>On your computer, import this text file into a program that understands tab-separated files, such as a spreadsheet application. You could use a text-editing application, too, as long as the display isn't set to wrap.</li>
		<li>Under the column <em>rating</em>, define rating for your items. When you're finished, export the data as a tab-separated file called <em>Shelves_to_Shelves_[Item].txt</em>, where [Item] is the capitalized plural name of the item you're exporting, such as Apparel, Books, Gadgets, Movies, Music, Software, Tools, Toys, or VideoGames.</li>
		<li>Copy <em>Shelves_to_Shelves_[Item].txt</em> to the root of your device's SD card.</li>
		<li>Delete your existing collection by going to <strong>Settings&rarr;Delete Everything</strong>.</li>
		<li>Reimport your Shelves collection by importing the saved file with your defined ratings: click <strong>Settings&rarr;Import&rarr;[Item]&rarr;Shelves</strong>.</li>
	</ol>
</p>	
<p>The import re-adds your collection, plus the ratings that you defined.</p>
