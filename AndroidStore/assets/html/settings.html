<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>The Settings screen provides the following options:
	<ul>
<li><strong>Region</strong>: Select the closest locale you want to use to find items. The default is United States, which is generally recommended for most items. There may be some cases where you'd want to change this. For instance, if you're looking for a French copy of Breton, you might find more accurate results by setting the locale to "France." If you're scanning a British DVD like <em>This is England</em>, set the locale to "United Kingdom." Region affects everything: adding manually, scanning barcodes, finding items online, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Calendar</strong>: Select the Google Calendar you want to use when adding <a href="loaning.html">Loan</a> events. This option is only available if you're using a Google Calendar.</li>
<li><strong>Import</strong>: Select this to <a href="importing.html">import a list of items</a> from files on your SD card.</li>
<li><strong>Export</strong>: Select this to <a href="exporting.html">export a list of items</a> as a tab-delimited text file to your SD card.</li>
<li><strong>Send To Google Docs</strong>: Uploads your collection to the Google Docs website as a spreadsheet. Note that you shouldn't rename the spreadsheet after it's uploaded, or you won't be able to import it back into your device. Your collection must be under 1 MB for this to work.</li>
<li><strong>Restore from Google Docs</strong>: Retrieves a previously uploaded collection from Google Docs, and begins to import it into Shelves. If any of the content was edited, those edits are reflected in the app collection.</li>
<li><strong>Delete Everything</strong>: Select this to wipe out your entire Shelves collection. You can also use this to restore your collection if something unexpectedly breaks. First, <a href="exporting.html">export your items for Shelves</a>. Then, delete everything. Finally, <a href="importing.html">import from Shelves</a>, using the saved export file you just created.</li>
</ul>
