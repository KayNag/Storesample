<p>To add an item, press the <strong>Add</strong> button on the action bar. <strong>Add</strong> lets you:
	<ul>
		<li>Add an item from the internet, where you can find an item online based on its title, creator, or keywords. If you long press on an item that's returned, you can view it online. You'll also get a brief description of the item. This helps you make sure you're adding the item you really want. Pressing an item in the list adds it to your collection. Press the refresh button on the Aciton Bar for more results. If the results aren't what you expected, consider more specific search terms, or <a href="settings.html">changing your locale in Settings</a>. <em>Adding items is dependent on your Internet connection, so considering using a WiFi connection for faster results.</em></li>
		<li>Add an item manually. You can enter all sorts of details to create a manual item. However, these items are genreally not backed up, and don't adhere to the same validation behavior as items added from the internet. In other words, <strong>add manual items at your own risk!</strong></li>
	</ul>
